## What is Vnet Peering in Azure??

### **VNet Peering in Azure**  

**VNet Peering** is a feature in Azure that connects two **Virtual Networks (VNets)** so that they can communicate **privately** with each other as if they were part of the same network.  

### **Key Points:**  
- Allows **low-latency, high-speed communication** between VNets.  
- VNets can be in the **same** or **different Azure regions** (Global VNet Peering).  
- No need for **VPN gateways** or **public IPs**â€”traffic remains within Azureâ€™s backbone network.  
- Can be used for **cross-region networking, resource sharing, or hybrid cloud solutions**.  

It is mainly used when you want to **connect different VNets securely** while maintaining network isolation. ðŸš€

### **Summary: Configuring VNet Peering in Azure**  

In this project, I set up **two Virtual Networks (VNets)**, each containing **one Virtual Machine (VM)**. To enable communication between the VMs, I configured **VNet Peering**, which allows the VNets to connect and exchange traffic securely over Azureâ€™s private network. This setup ensures seamless connectivity without requiring VPN gateways or public IPs, demonstrating how VNet Peering can be used for efficient and secure inter-VNet communication.

## Step - 1

i. Configure the **Virtual Networks (VNets)** by creating two separate VNets, each assigned with its own address space.

ii. Create the **first VNet** with the specified **IP address range**.

iii. Create the **second VNet** with the specified **IP address range**.

## Step - 2

i. Now, create the **first Virtual Machine (VM)** and ensure that you select the **correct VNet (VNet-1)** during the setup.

ii. Create the **second Virtual Machine (VM)** and ensure that you select **VNet-2** during the setup.

## Step - 3

i. Connect to both **VMs using RDP**, then **turn off the firewall** on both VMs to allow seamless communication between them.

## Step - 4

i. Navigate to **Virtual Network**, select the **VNet** you created, go to the **Peering** section, and click on the **Add** button.

ii. Assign a name to the **peering link**, select the **virtual network** you want to establish communication with, and click **Save**.

iii. Once the **VNet Peering** is configured, test the connection by **pinging between the VMs**â€”they should now be able to communicate successfully.
